    Your everlasting summer
    You can see it fading fast
    So you grab a piece of something
    That you think is gonna last
    But you wouldn't know a diamond
    If you held it in your hand
    The things you think are precious
    I can't understand
    Are you reelin' in the years
    Stowin' away the time
    Are you gatherin' up the tears
    Have you had enough of mine
    Are you reelin' in the years
    Stowin' away the time
    Are you gatherin' up the tears
    Have you had enough of mine
    You been tellin' me you're a genius
    Since you were seventeen
    In all the time I've known you
    I still don't know what you mean
    The weekend at the college
    Didn't turn out like you planned
    The things that pass for knowledge
    I can't understand
    Are you reelin' in the years
    Stowin' away the time
